## Welcome to my ePortfolio

My name is Mr. Adam Barbour and I am currently an educator @ Salamah College NSW. 

I also am currently studying a Masters of Education at Charles Sturt University and have been enjoying the area of teaching. My area of teaching is currently Technology (Year 7, 8) and Information Software Technology (Year 9 and 10). 

I am also currently undertaking projects in ICT which are underdevelopment. One of my new projects is https://wiki.informationsoftware.tech/ which aims to complement my programs for Information Software Technology. 

This project is long-term but my hope is to strengthen ICT awareness amongst students and teach them relevant knowledge within the constantly-evolving industry of digital technologies. 

Tutorials are quickly outdated, so my approach is to teach fundamentals of ICT which they can apply to the changing nature of technology.
