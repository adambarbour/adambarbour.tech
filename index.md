## Welcome to my ePortfolio

My name is Mr. Adam Barbour and I am currently an educator @ Salamah College NSW. 

I also am currently studying a Masters of Education at Charles Sturt University and have been enjoying the area of teaching. My area of teaching is currently Technology (Year 7, 8) and Information Software Technology (Year 9 and 10). 

I am also currently undertaking projects in ICT which are underdevelopment. One of my new projects is https://wiki.informationsoftware.tech/ which aims to complement my programs for Information Software Technology. 

This project is long-term but my hope is to strengthen ICT awareness amongst students and teach them relevant knowledge within the constantly-evolving industry of digital technologies. 

Tutorials are quickly outdated, so my approach is to teach fundamentals of ICT which they can apply to the changing nature of technology. 

### Educating code using Markdown

Using Markdown is an excellent way to get students into coding. You can use markdowns to show iterations, declarations, loops, functions, classes in a variety of programming languages. Whilst the code cannot be debugged, students see code as if it is in an IDE (Independent Dev. Environment) and when learning to program using VSCode, scratch, adruino can better implement code they learnt from your site. See below an example markdown of a HTML page. 

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

<HTML>
  <Head>
    <Title></Title>
  </Head>
  <Body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Site!</h1>
    
    <style>
      .h1{
          font-color: red;
          font-size: 80px;
          }
    </style>
  </Body>
  </HTML>
```
