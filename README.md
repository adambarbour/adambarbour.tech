Hi welcome to my Git Repo.

My name is Mr. Adam Barbour.

This is where I post any technical projects I work on and host my git pages site adambarbour.tech!

I am currently studying a Masters of Education at CSU and teaching Technology at Salamah College.

### History of me and my philosophy teaching ICT

I hold a Diploma of IT Systems Administration (Distinction) in 2012, and worked as a sole-trader in ICT helping small businesses and home users diagnose and resolve technical issues. 

I then moved onto doing a Bachelor's of Law at Western Sydney University, completing the program in 2019 and being admitted as an Australian Lawyer in 2020. I worked for a few months in the law, however I then moved onto teaching and I currently enjoy working in teaching. Getting students learn to use ICT effectively has given me a great satisfaction knowing that I am preparing them for the new Industrial Revolution. We are living in a new world from the old world, life will never be the same pre-covid. I also amended programs of teaching to cater for the new world, ensuring students learn about AI, IoT and the new way domains are working with TLDs (Top Level Domains).

If you noticed anything unique about my website from other students, is that the domain is a .tech TLD.
